## Workshops Overview

### 1️⃣ Workshop 1: Client-Server Fundamentals
**Focus:** Low-level programming with Sockets in C (Winsock) and Python.

### 2️⃣ Workshop 2: Advanced Patterns
**Focus:** Scalable Architectures with Middleware (ZeroMQ). Includes RMI, Pub-Sub, and Pipeline patterns.

### 3️⃣ Workshop 3: DNS and LDAP Implementation
**Focus:** Name Resolution and Directory Services. Programmatic DNS queries and LDAP authentication logic.

### 4️⃣ Workshop 4: Coordination, Logical Time & Mutual Exclusion
**Focus:** Handling Time and Shared Resources.
*   **Clock Sync:** Centralized (UTC) and Decentralized (Berkeley-like) synchronization.
*   **Logical Time:** Vector Clocks for causality tracking.
*   **Mutual Exclusion:** Managing shared resource access via Centralized Coordinators and Decentralized Token Rings.

### 5️⃣ Workshop 5: Distributed Databases (Scalability & Consistency)
**Focus:** Data Partitioning and Concurrency in a Distributed Environment.
*   **Replication & Sharding:** Implementing Primary-Replica redundancy and Horizontal/Vertical sharding.
*   **Concurrency Control:** Analyzing and solving anomalies like Lost Updates, Replica Lag, and Deadlocks using GTID and MySQL Row-level locking.

## 🚀 Technologies & Libraries
*   **Core:** Python 3.11+, GCC Compiler.
*   **Databases:** MySQL 8.0+, Docker & Docker Compose.
*   **Middleware:** [ZeroMQ (pyzmq)](https://zeromq.org/) for high-performance messaging.
*   **Libraries:** `dnspython`, `xmlrpc`, `threading`.
